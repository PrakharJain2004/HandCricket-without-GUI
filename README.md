# HandCricket-without-GUI
In this project I used python language to create a game called Hand cricket.
** What is HAND CRICKET? **
So this is a game in which we mimic the game cricket by using our hands(fingers) to add runs and give a score.
The computer will randomly guess and if the runs of you and the computer matches the one eho is batting will get out.
