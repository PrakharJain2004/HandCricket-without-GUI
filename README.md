# HandCricket-without-GUI
In this project I used python language to create a game called Hand cricket.
What is Hand Cricket?
So this is a game in which we mimic the game cricket by using our hands(fingers) to add runs and give a score.
The computer will randomly guess and if the runs of you and the computer matches the one eho is batting will get out.
How to run this?
To run this program in your laptop you have to clone it first
